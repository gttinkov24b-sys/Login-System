# Login-System (C# Console application)

A simple console application for C# that I used to test Visual Studio 2026 and practice some programming.

### What was learned/practiced:
- **Console.Clear()**: to refresh the console
- **System.Threading.Thread.Sleep()**: to add delays for better user experience
- Reinforced basic C# skills: loops, conditionals, and string handling

Notes: This is a beginner-level project
